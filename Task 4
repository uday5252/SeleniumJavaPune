### Question 7: Inheritance — Zoo Animals

Implement a simple zoo hierarchy using Javascript inheritance by creating two classes: **Animal** and **Lion**.

**Requirements:**

* Both classes should implement a method `getType()` that returns:

  * `"Animal"` for the **Animal** class
  * `"Lion"` for the **Lion** class (overrides parent)

**Input Format:**

* First line → Integer (number of entries)
* Next lines → `"Animal"` or `"Lion"`

**Sample Input:**

```
3
Animal
Lion
Lion
```

**Sample Output:**

```
Animal
Lion
Lion
```
