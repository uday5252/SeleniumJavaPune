Encapsulation in Action — Library Management (Tracking Books)

Implement a **`Library`** class in JavaScript demonstrating **encapsulation**.

**Requirements:**

* Maintain a **private property** `books` (number of books), which starts at `0`.
* Provide the following methods:

  * `addBook(amount: number)` → Adds books if `amount > 0`.
  * `borrowBook(amount: number)` → Reduces books if enough are available.
  * `getBooks()` → Returns total books available.

**Input Format:**

* First line → Integer (number of operations)
* Next lines → Operation (`add`, `borrow`, or `books`)

**Sample Input:**

```
5
add 10
borrow 3
books
borrow 9
books
```

**Sample Output:**

```
7
7
```
