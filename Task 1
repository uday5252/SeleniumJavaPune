 2. Car Rental Summary

 3. Student Scholarship Calculation

A university awards scholarships to students based on their grades and fee amounts.
Each student has a `fee` and `grade` (out of 10).
The scholarship amount is calculated as a percentage of the fee depending on the grade.

Input:

```js
const students = [
  { name: 'Riya', fee: 30000, grade: 9 },

```



 4. Real Estate Commission Report

A real estate agency earns a commission from each property sold.
Each sale has a `propertyPrice` and `commissionRate` (in %).
The agency wants the total commission from sales where the commission earned is above ₹50,000.

const sales = [
  { propertyPrice: 800000, commissionRate: 5 },
