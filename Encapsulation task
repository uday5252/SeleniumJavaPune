 🏦 Scenario:

You have been asked to design a basic ATM system for a bank. The goal is to ensure data security by hiding sensitive information like the PIN and account balance.
You must use encapsulation to protect these details and allow access only through specific methods.

---

🧩 Problem Description:

Create a class called `ATM` that:

* Has two private fields:

  * `pin` (int) → represents the secret PIN of the user.
  * `balance` (double) → represents the user’s account balance.

* Provides the following methods:

  1. `checkPin(int inputPin)` →
     Verifies whether the entered PIN matches the stored one.
     If the PIN is correct, allow further transactions.
     Otherwise, print “Invalid PIN! Access Denied.”

  2. `deposit(double amount)` →
     Adds the given amount to the balance only if the correct PIN was entered before.
     If not, print “Please verify your PIN first.”

  3. `withdraw(double amount)` →
     Deducts the given amount from the balance only if the correct PIN was entered and sufficient funds are available.
     Otherwise, print the appropriate error message.

  4. `checkBalance()` →
     Displays the current balance only if the PIN is correct.
